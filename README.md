# PowerBI-Projects

On the site I will share my projects that I work on in my spare time to document my progress in the use of the Power BI tool.

# Global Superstore Analysis

First project done from scratch in Power BI.
Dashboard presents the most important information that should be included on a one-page dashboard showing profit and income of the company at different levels.
Bookmarks have been included in the report to switch between Total Sales and Total Profit. The line graph updates depending on which choice you make.
Slicer allows you to adjust the results after selecting the appropriate year as well as month.
When you hover your mouse over one of the Donut charts, it allows you to view a tooltip that displays more detailed information about the category.

The database was downloaded from kaggle.com

The second project made in Power BI. This is an analysis of the stock market index and listed companies from 2012 to 2022. I was able to use the DAX language several times in the project.
The project was divided into two pages - the first one presents the most important information about the S&P500 stock index. Here you can find a chart showing the change in the index over 10 years, as well as the largest companies according to Marketcap and EBIDTA In addition, we can indicate the amount we would like to invest in 2012, and the dashboard will show the amount we could gain after 10 years.
On the first page we can also select the company we are interested in. Aside from an interactive map that will indicate the company's headquarters, the rest of the filtering on the first page is disabled and we have to go to the next page to find more details about the company.


On the second page you can find basic information about the company and how its price has changed over the years. Additional visualizations are downloaded that allow us to compare the company's value, EBIDTA or revenue growth compared to the sector. Also, we can enter the amount we would like to invest in the company to see how much we could gain/lose.


The database was downloaded from kaggle.com. Due to the large file size, the sp500_companies table could not be included.
The downloaded model of the .pbix file shows the values of companies after 2015, because the model had to be reduced to make it available on github.
